#Open Source Definition
####In summary open source is a collaborative effort to create free software available for use and change 
#within the entire community. But since this software is free to use, there doesn't necessarily exist any
#manual or technical support. If a person or group develop an open source, he/she or they will generally get 
#most or all the credit. Open Source should also be transparent, and should not be hiding any code from
# the users. The software can be used for anything and everything. Point number 5 gets into certain 
# limitiations of excessive freedom. This clause is necessary because people may get too flexible with
#their freedoms in terms of culture and society. In general, open source is open for working with the software
#,working on the software, and communicating about the software.
