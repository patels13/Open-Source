#Open Source Definition
####In summary open source is a collaborative effort to create free software available for use and change 
within the entire community. But since this software is free to use, there doesn't necessarily exist any
manual or technical support. If a person or group develop an open source, he/she or they will generally get 
most or all the credit. Open Source should also be transparent, and should not be hiding any code from
the users. The software can be used for anything and everything. Point number 5 gets into certain 
limitiations of excessive freedom. This clause is necessary because people may get too flexible with
their freedoms in terms of culture and society. In general, open source is open for working with the software
,working on the software, and communicating about the software.
