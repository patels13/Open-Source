#Open Source Definition

In summary open source is a collaborative effort to create free software available for use and change 
within the entire community. But since this software is free to use, there doesn't necessarily exist any
manual or technical support. If a person or group develop an open source, he/she or they will generally get 
most or all the credit. Open Source should also be transparent, and should not be hiding any code from
the users. The software can be used for anything and everything. Point number 5 gets into certain 
limitiations of excessive freedom. This clause is necessary because people may get too flexible with
their freedoms in terms of culture and society. In general, open source is open for working with the software
,working on the software, and communicating about the software.

#How to Ask Questions

In order to be successful in the industry of computer science, one must also be successful in the art of asking questions. The hackers must feel challenged and motivated to spend a bit of their time for you. Questions are meant to make the experts think, and the answers must not be obvious. The article emphasizes that humans are not websites, yet people do treat other people that way 
unintentionally. Humans are smarter than that and deserve questions worth thinking. Therefore, the types of questions you ask are
the types of relationships you will develop with the hacker community. And the questions should be structured in a way to reflect your own intelligence and competence worth looking after. Help others and also ask for help, but don't make yourself look like a fool while doing it. 
Some other tips for asking questions is:
1. Make sure the question you want answered is actually a question. Otherwise, this might put the hacker in a conundrum
  if you are asking a question or just simply stating the obvious. 
2. When answering someone else's question, showing off is not cool. Unless your answer helps the person with their question,
  it does not seem nice to just go off on a tangent and start talking about you. A forum is a community, not a place for someone to 
  be selfish.
