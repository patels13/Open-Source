HOMEWORK1--
	I joined the linux channel on freenode, and found that this channel as well as many other channels is basically used as a technical support group as well as a place to share some new topics on gaming or other techie related material. In some ways, this support group can be way better than actual customer service one may get from calling the company who built a specific gadget or software. The topics can range from general “what do you like about this certain feature or how you feel about this certain feature” to how something actually works right down to the low-level hardware. The chat is also used to share specific links or videos that one may have found interesting regarding the topic one is discussing. There one person who actually sent a link to a video about a game in unity that he made. People are pretty free to say whatever they want whenever they want, as long as it is appropriate and relates to the chat topic in some way or another. One or two people usually just start talking about a problem or issue they might be having with certain hardware/software and then people will just join on to help solve or leave side comments. Sometimes people generate better alternatives to solving such problems. Usually there are a lot of multiple conversations going on, so you must declare who specifically you are aiming to talk to in the comments you post in the chat. Sometimes a person will come on and say something that is way off topic of what the whole channel or chat was originally set up to do. This person usually gets picked at or is responded with sarcastic humor. There are also some very funny lines people say in this chat relating to how certain hardware or software works, or why some inventory is proprietary or not. It gets hard to follow a chat if multiple conversations arise, and you have to look up which conversation each mini-conversation refers to. The sourceforge channel has no such conversations arise in the time that I joined till now, people just left and joined. Internet Relay Chats are mainly designed for group communication in the format of discussions, but also allows for one-on-one communication via private messages, as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing. 
	The IRC enables users to connect to a server using a software program to talk to each other in live time. Each user must have an IRC client to connect to the server. I had ChatZilla on Firefox. There are many commands to shortcut certain communication methods or ways or talking to save time and be efficient. IRC have a line-based structure. Clients may send messages to the server, receive replies to those messages, and receive copies of some messages sent by other clients. In most clients, users can enter commands by prefixing them with a ‘/’. Depending on the command, these may either be handled entirely by the client, or passed directly to the server, possibly with some modification.  You can also ignore certain other users on the chat that you may not want to hear from or just annoy you. In conclusion, IRC is a place for individuals and organizations to share, play, work, and complain with each other around the world instead of just people you know. I can see this as being a fun, useful, and reliable piece of technology for our generation. 
	Some things I noticed was that people on such Internet Relay chats usually don’t care about other topics other than technology in Internet Relay Chats. There may be some chatting going on about such things, but usually they make up less than half of the chats that happen. I like the element of how IRC is decentralized and not controlled by a single company or organization. The channel’s paradigm is also very flexible and allows real-time discussion with many people. There is the nice security that I enjoy, so you can be sure to not be talking to frauds or people with ill means. A channel can be kept secret or private and not show up in the list of available channels to join, and users can only be added by seeing their IP address validation. Also, people can meet (behind the screen) and share different thoughts with other people who they probably have never seen in their lives. This can provide a whole new perspective on fixing bugs or thoughts about certain technology or other opinions in other topics. But I guess sometimes hyperboles, jokes, and sarcasm and be misunderstood by other people. In general though, these chats are great and provide insight into a lot of things in the world from different parts of the world.

Part4
-Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication
Asynchronous communication works kind of like a post office, where a message is created by an application which may be in the form of a text or other piece of data, and the message is labeled with a destination address. This message is then passed along a messaging middleware system that contains integration between two systems. Synchronous communication works more like a phone, where the receiver or the system receiving the response must be available, otherwise the message cannot be sent and communication cannot be taken place. Synchronous messaging involves a client that waits for the server to respond to a message. This means it is a two-way communication. Asynchronous does not wait for a message from the server. It is a one way communication.
-Compare the HCI issues in individual interaction with group interaction.
The disadvantages of human interface interaction is that it may require users to learn commands or language, there may also be hidden features, and it’s not very helpful for novice users. The user interface may also be limited by screen space and the number of options available. The emerging technology is also not completely reliable in that it may contain bugs. In terms of the natural language interface, it can also be difficult to recognize all the different ways of saying things. 
-Discuss several issues of social concern raised by collaborative software.
It is extremely hard to synchronize the schedules of the participants, and when there is a change in the schedule of one person, this can lead to quite a lot of turmoil for the rest. In conclusion, it can reduce efficiency of getting work done. There is also less reliability. When a server goes down, everyone in the group is affected, not only one person. You may also be tied to a vendor , and so exporting or sharing data can be impossible. The flexibility is gone.

 -Discuss the HCI issues in software that embodies human intention.
Human-computer interaction is concerned with designing interactions between human activities and the computational systems that support them, with interfaces to take into account all these interactions. This interface includes both software and hardware. Therefor the basic design and implementation can influence the user interface-for better or for worse. And since this area of study involves computer knowledge as well as people, there needs to be a basis for cultural, social, cognitive, and perceptual issues that must be taken into account. 

NUMBER4
I do agree that on some cases a style guide may prove to be useful, but in other cases it might not. I feel like for error generation, a style guide may prove to be not useful. I feel like we actually have to know what the code is doing to figure out these errors. Now I’m not saying that the style guide is not useful at all to detect error generation, I am just saying that it should not be a first resort to go to when checking the problems behind error generation. But I do agree that style guides can make a team work together way better. Especially when it comes to dealing with different APIs and how to read in certain input, these style guides can save a lot of trouble of going through the proper way of reading in outside material and having it be uniform throughout the code. Therefore, I also agree with Douglas Crockford that styling can definitely reduce error in code in the future. At one point though, I believe he mentioned something about left braces being an unused style. But I feel like it actually helps to see the right bracket to match up to the left bracket.
