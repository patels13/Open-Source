We need a license in order to give credit to the original makers of the project.Licenses are granted
to allow usage, and to what degree that use is limited. It can also be used to maintain
copyright, and who has to exclusive right to own the work. The license also provides a means
to redistribution and if the work can be redistributed or changed at all. 

If a project does not have an explicit license, that means the project would automatically
be all rights reserved. This means that the copyright holder reserves, or holds for their
own use, all the rights to the work. Therefore if you do use that project for your own 
use, you would be breaking a law. 

I don't completely agree with this claim. If we leave the software open early in the process,
then people will take advantage of each other. There may be differences and certain disagreements
with what this software actually needs. I think the creators should come up with the main
ideas and important decisions in the software, implementing them by themselves. The other 
creative aspect of what the program can contain should be left to the community.

Android is used on a lot of many different devices. Google publishes most of the code
under the non-copyleft Apache License which allows modification and redistribution. 
The community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices
faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, with a comparable
level of quality. This can also bring Android to devices running under other operating
systems. There can be propriety software released on android. For Linux, the GPL requires that
anyone who distributes software based on source code under this license, must make
the originating source code available to the recipient under the same terms. 

SquareMeals will probably have a BSD license.

The GPL seems like a good license for the developer community to view and modify the source code.
The LGPL mainly consists of libraries so this may be very good for the common good. The Apache/BSD
will probably be better for a company. This is because companies must have some limitation
to redistribution of their software. GPLs' on the other hand, like Linux should be available
in order to use for certain devices or programs, including android. Everyone might probably
need libraries to make other code.

I think I want to build a project around combining lecture notes with textbook material,
if the textbooks are online, probably as a chrome extension. I intend to make 
this under the MIT License since this project is not really too complicated for an Apache License.
There can be much added to this chrome extension and doesn't really need any restrictions.
Everybody should be able to use this extension as they wish. And it should be shared
as much as possible.
