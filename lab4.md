There was a run-on sentence in Chapter 14, so we inserted parentheses to keep the main aspect
of the sentence, and the extra features were talked about inside the parentheses. Also, Chrooted was 
not a word in the dictionary. We changed this to "chroot-ed". We also found an on screen without
a hyphen in between, so we changed this to on-screen. The on-screen was in 5.2 terminology.

It is important to direct users to a straightforward, easy way to process all the information
and a good step-by-step guide of accessing the information."It allows users and developers to get the 
software running correctly and quickly, reduces frustration, gets new users excited for the software
,and enhances programming effort. Good documentation enables good code."

I learned how to checkout from the svn repository and make changes to the documentation,
while consulting to the company about these changes.
